An implementation of dribble in clojure.


Syntax: dribble &optional pathname

Sends a record of all input & output to pathname, which must be a suitable argument to clojure.contrib.duck-streams/writer. This can be called many times.
Calling dribble with no arguments terminates the most recent transcript.
Currently only *in* and *out* are redirected, *err* remains untouched.
